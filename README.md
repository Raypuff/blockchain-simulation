After wasting too much time NOT understanding what the heck Blockchain is and how it works, I decided to hunker down and spend some time understanding it. From a Fireship video (https://lnkd.in/gRqahqiB), I learned a bit more about how cryptocurrencies work and then subsequently followed their tutorial to build a simple simulation of my own blockchain.

Even though the tutorial blazed through the content really quickly and repeatedly blew my mind, I managed to follow along and picked up some important concepts. Using the in-built crypto module in Node and building it using Typescript and OOP concepts, I learned about hashing, SHA256, Genesis Blocks, RSA for making digital signatures with private keys, mining to solve computational puzzles for the double-spend issue, and much more!

I know this doesn't make me an expert on FinTech and I'm just barely scratching the surface but I just wanted to share this little late-night experience because it made me realize once again that all the knowledge you need to become an expert on anything is out there - you just have to go and look for it! :)
